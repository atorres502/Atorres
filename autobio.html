            <p class="maintext">Hi, I'm the author of this webpage, Alex T.. I am currently working towards my
                Associates in Science in Web Development at Waubonsee Community College. On the way I will also be
                collecting my Web Author certificate as well. Aside from my school life
                I'm a musician who plays guitar, drums, bass, and sings. I am also a gamer and spend most of
                my time switching between different MMO's; Also adding the occasional competitive game into the
                mix to keep my brain sharp (grinding gear is a chore). Thank you for taking the time to read my
                short little autobiography.
            </p>
